## Importing Libraries
The script initiates by importing essential libraries, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`, to enable data manipulation and visualization.

## Loading and Exploring Data
Data is loaded from an Excel file into the `happy_df` DataFrame. The script displays the first 10 rows of the dataset and identifies missing values using `isnull().sum()`.

## Top 10 Happiest Countries
A scatterplot is generated to showcase the top 10 happiest countries in 2021 based on their ladder scores.

## Top 10 Saddest Countries
A scatterplot is created to highlight the top 10 saddest countries in 2021 based on their ladder scores.

## Total Ladder Score by Region
A pie chart is used to illustrate the total ladder scores by region.

## Top 10 Countries with Highest GDP
A line plot is generated to display the top 10 countries with the highest GDP in 2021.

## Top 10 Countries with Lowest GDP
A line plot is generated to display the top 10 countries with the lowest GDP in 2021.

## Total GDP by Region
An area plot showcases the total GDP contribution from each region in 2021.

## Top 10 Countries with Highest Life Expectancy
A point plot is created to visualize the top 10 countries with the highest life expectancy in 2021.

## Top 10 Countries with Lowest Life Expectancy
A point plot is created to visualize the top 10 countries with the lowest life expectancy in 2021.

## Total Life Expectancy by Region
A bar plot illustrates the total life expectancy by region in 2021.

## Correlation Map
A correlation map is displayed using a heatmap to visualize correlations between different attributes in the dataset.
